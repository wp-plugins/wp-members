= 3.0.6 =

= 3.0.4 =

* Reintroduced the global action variable $wpmem_a for backward compatibility with certain add-ons, most notably the WP-Members MailChimp extension ( see https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members-mailchimp-integration/ ). Users of this extension should upgrade.  This variable had been replaced with the new WP-Members object class introduced in 3.0. However, users of older extensions and those that may have customziations with logic may be using this variable, so rather than force updating and upgrading, it is being added back in.
* Change to the priority of functions hooked to the the_content filter. Lowering the priority should better integrate the plugin with various builder plugins and other processes that currently filter the_content after WP-Members since the content will now be filtered later in the process. This also should improve situations where in the past the on-the-fly texturization shortcode for the WP-Members forms might remain unparsed.

* Bug fix typo in $wpmem object name in admin/user-profile.php.

* Fixed autoexcerpt to use setting from object and not wpmemembers_autoex option.
* Added filter to remove comments array if content is blocked.

= 3.0.0 =

This release makes significant changes to the plugin's main options in the way they are stored.

* Bug fix for premium PayPal Subscription extension showing expired users, improved user query.

= 2.9.0 =

This is a major update focusing on upgrades to the form building functions, but also includes a number of other changes and improvements.

Major updates

* New form building functions include new hooks and a more customizable form building process.
* Form functions moved from wp-members-dialogs.php to new file forms.php
* Sidebar login form also rebuilt in the same way the login and register forms were changed.
* Legacy (old table based) forms completely removed in 2.9
* Updates to error and dialog messages, removed unnecessary html tags

Changes in wp-members-core.php

* updated calling of wpmem_test_shortcode, now it works like has_shortcode, put off deprecating at this time.
* updated shortcode to include tos page, allow for new tags (wpmem_field, wpmem_logged_in) (added new shortcode calls in wp-members.php), and accept id attribute for fields. Added $tag argument, can use shortcode_atts_{$shortcode} filter
* moved wpmem_test_shortcode to utilities.php
* added new action hooks: wpmem_pwd_change and wpmem_pwd_reset
* added new filter hook: wpmem_regchk

Changes in wp-members.php

* a pretty major overhaul of this file. Moved all but four declarations that weren't already in functions into the init function. Only two constants are declared before the function. This initialization comes after the theme is setup, so pre-initilization needs, such as loading pluggable functions can be declared in the theme's functions.php file. Pluggable functions do not need to be loaded only from the wp-members-pluggable.php file.
* The file name of the wp-members-pluggable.php file is loaded in a filter hook, wpmem_plugins_file, so you could call it something else or load it from another location.
* New action hooks: wpmem_pre_init, wpmem_after_init, wpmem_pre_admin_init, wpmem_after_admin_init
* New filter hook: wpmem_settings

Miscellaneous Changes

* Updates to the html for some of the admin to better fit the new WP admin layout. Old html was compatible, but the new works better.
* Updates to the options tab to better group options
* Updates to native (wp-login.php) registration to include require field indication
* Review of output, localized a few missed strings
* Implementation of changes in localization of field names. English values are now stored in the db (except for custom fields that would be whatever language the user creates the field as). Fields are then translated when displayed, rather than stored as translated strings.
* Updated user profile to fix some issues with checkbox and required fields in users.php
* Updated user export to include wp_users table fields user_url, user_nicename, and display_name fields
* Code cleanup in wpmem_block function
* Updated autoexcerpt function
* New filter hooks for post editor meta box titles: wpmem_admin_post_meta_title, wpmem_admin_page_meta_title
* Some updates to existing stylesheets
* Added new stylesheets, including two with non-floated elements. Generic, non-floated stylesheet new default for fresh installs

= 2.8.10 = 

This is a security update the closes 2 reported XSS vulnerabilities.  This update also includes a fix for using SSL with reCAPTCHA.

= 2.8.9 =

This is an interim update with some changes that need to get done prior to the 2.9 release.  Note: This is the last version that will be compatible with WordPress 3.1.  Also, this will be the last version to contain the legacy table based forms.  These have been deprecated since version 2.8.0.

* Added a Twenty Fourteen stylesheet based on the new WP default theme.
* Twenty Fourteen installs as the default stylesheet with a new install
* User export fix - the new user export functions from 2.8.7 were inadvertenly incompatible with PHP 5.2.4 (WP minimum requirements)
* Admin options tab style/layout updates to work better with new WP (3.8) admin theme
* Moved the plugin's texurize process into wpmem_securify rather than in the form functions. This is going to happen in 2.9, and doing it as an interim update will allow users to test 2.9 with pluggable functions.
* Added the texturize process to the shortcode function for the same reason as above, plus this runs on the User List extension as well.
* Made the shortcode function pluggable
* Improved the auto excerpt function

= 2.8.8 =

* Updated no password reset for non-activated users to use get_user_by('email')
* Fixed undefined variable $sendback in users.php
* Fixed undefined user object in wpmem_check_activated function
* Set a column width for the WP-Members column in the All Posts and All Pages admin panels, load admin.css
* Added wpmem_admin_after_block_meta and wpmem_admin_block_meta_save actions

= 2.8.7 =

* Upgraded the user export process.  Eliminates the need for directly loading an export file as in past versions.  This also eliminates the need for wp-load.php.
* All user management functions that were in the Users > WP-Members menu are now included under Users > All Users.  The Users > WP-Members menu is fully deprecated and removed.
* Corrected some undefined variable notices.
* New filter for the widget title wpmem_widget_title
* Further enhancements to the native WP registration. Even though the plugin was intended to put the registration process into the front end of your WP site, there are always users that either (a) prefer to use the backend native registration or (b) don't read or follow installation and usage instructions. So in an earlier version, I went ahead and added the WP-Members custom fields to the backend registration if it is turned on. This version finishes that process with proper support for dropdown select fields, checkboxes, and text area fields.  It also cleans up the error checking and CSS styling for that process.

= 2.8.6 =

* Continued updating the stylesheets, this update includes some minor changes to 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 to clean up the .noinput class (used in the User Profile update) and the reCAPTCHA area.
* Added responsive elements to the Twenty Twelve stylesheet (remains the plugin's default)
* Changed from PHP_SELF to REQUEST_URI for elements where the plugin forms need to post back to themselves and no other URL exists
* Changed from "siteurl" to "home" for getting the home page link - corrects problems for users who have WP installed in a different directory

= 2.8.5 =

* Improved the Twenty Eleven and Twenty Twelve stylesheets (Twenty Twelve remains the plugin default).
* Added a responsive stylesheet based on Twenty Thirteen theme.
* Added a new filter hook for password reset args wpmem_pwdreset_args. This will allow mods for single stage reset (username only or email only).
* Corrected update_user_meta during registration use the filtered value of the user's IP and registration URL.

= 2.8.4 =

* Fixed a small bug on admin-side user profile that caused checkboxes to not update correctly
* Added optional small "powered by" attribution link at the bottom of the registration form.

= 2.8.3 =

Feature Updates

* Allows native fields display_name, nicename, and nickname to be removed from the field manager.
* New filter wpmem_logout_link filters all logout links.
* Added default registration via wp-login page (backend).  This of course can be disabled by unchecking "anyone can register" in the WP settings.
* Completion of user admin panel implementation.  Added screens for non-active and non-exported users.
* Added a custom column to page/post tables to indicate if a post/page is blocked/unblocked opposite the chosen default setting.

Fixes

* Fixed bug in admin/post.php that caused an error due a typo in the selected capability.
* Applied the patch for the users table custom columns that didn't return non-WP-Members custom column values.
* Fixed the use of the nonce constant to check if the constant is defined.
* Applied patch to the utilities file that left some debugging code artifacts in the 2.8.2 release.

Improvements

* Updated dashboard widget to either superadmin or not display for multisite.
* Added a div tag to the "Required Field" text in the registration form - NOTE: if you run any filters on the registration form, you may need to test them and update accordingly.
* Updated the included stylesheets for the addition of req-text class for the "Required Field" text in the registration form.

= 2.8.2 =

* Added wpmem_pre_validate_form for $fields to allow filtering fields prior to default form field validation.
* Begin implementation of moving bulk user management features into Users > All Users.  Users > All Users screen can now activate and export users, and will show additional fields as selected in the fields manager. 
* Added wpmem_admin_profile_heading, wpmem_admin_profile_field, and wpmem_admin_profile_update filters. These filters are all part of the user profile section.

Fixes, Patches, & Code Improvements

* Fixed the conversion of update-profile to members-area shortcode.  The bug renders all page shortcodes as members-area.
* Fixed the activate user process for user defined passwords, a bug from 2.8.0/2.8.1.
* Fixed a bug that can cause the sidebar login widget to not post to the correct url when a static front page is used.
* Fixed user profile update (updates with custom checkbox don't stay checked), an issue from 2.8.0.
* Patch correcting the front-side registration form nonce.  This patch should improve reliability while still using nonces for security.
* Patch for the dropdown field for users running < PHP 5.3.
* Made front-side nonce optional, defaults to off.
* Moved utility functions out of core.php to utility file utilities.php.

= 2.8.1 =

Security update release: 2.8.1 primarily closes some potential security holes.  This update is highly recommended.

Security Updates:

* Closed potential cross site scripting exploit
* Added nonces to front-side registration
* Updated nonces in admin form submission
* Security evaluation and updates to other areas

Feature Updates:

* Added dropdown option for User Profile (members-area) and Register page location
* Updated dropdown field to accommodate commas in the values (ex: 1,000)

Other Updates:

* Updated TOS shortcode to be case-insensitive for the shortcode parameter (TOS/tos)
* Begin deprecating members-area parameter to be replaced with user-profile
* Separated User Profile functions from wp-members-core.php file
* Applied post 2.8.0 patches and corrected missing files

= 2.8.0 =

New Feature release: 2.8.0 offers the beginning of a major rebuild of the admin panels with a few front-side features slipped in along the way.

Security Improvements:

* Added a dummy index.php file in all plugin directories.  This is a security improvement and disallows direct access to a directory (in case your server allows directory browsing).

Code Improvements:

* Added new constants WPMEM_DIR and WPMEM_PATH.  This will allow you to grab the directory of the plugin directly in action and filter functions.
* Broke up the admin file wp-members-admin.php into multiple files based on function.  These are all now moved into an /admin/ directory.
* Added the password field to the fields array in the registration function so that this can be used in the registration hooks and filters.
* Updated the logout process to use wp_clear_auth_cookie.  The previous wp_clearcookie was deprecated and was causing header errors in some instances.
* Improved the TOS shortcode. This should eliminate some of the parsing errors some users experienced in previous releases.

Admin Panel Updates:

* New admin look updates the tabs to the WP format.  This also was built to allow extensible tabs so you can hook in and create your own tabs and panels.
* Add field dialog was updated and improved.
* Added an admin process to edit existing fields.
* Added new option in the plugin options to load one of the predefined stylesheets from a dropdown.
* Block/Unblock post meta box added to the post/page editor – no need to use custom fields anymore (this feature actually updates the custom fields accordingly, so you can use custom fields if you want to).
* Added dropdown selector for preloaded stylesheets - no need to enter the location of the preloaded stylesheets to use them.

New Filters:

* wpmem_admin_tabs - allows developers to hook into the admin tabs to add additional tabs.
* wpmem_admin_style_list - allows developers to hook into the dropdown list of stylesheets to add additional stylesheets.
* wpmem_auto_excerpt - filters the automatically generated excerpt.  Allows you to customize a 'read more' link.
* wpmem_post_password - filters the automatically generated post password that blocks comments on blocked posts/pages.
* wpmem_forgot_link - filters the forgot password link that shows in the login forms.
* wpmem_reg_link - filters the register link that shows in the login forms.

Other Updates:

* Added a new pre-loaded stylesheet for Twenty Twelve theme.  New installs will default to this style.  Note: with the addition of the new style selector in the admin panel, you can easily toggle between the preloaded stylesheets.  You can also add your own using the new wpmem_admin_style_list filter, enter the URL location in the Custom Stylesheet field, or load one using wp_enqueue_scripts.

= 2.7.7 =

New Features:

* Added a new filter hook wpmem_securify.  This hook applies a filter to the $content variable at the end of the wpmem_securify function.  The primary reason for this hook is to be able to run filters on $content that would give you the ability to block content even if the user is logged in (the wpmem_block filter only works for non-logged in state).  This will bring in the ability to block users from content based on defined criteria such as content is for members of "group A" but the user is does not have access to "group A" content.
* Added wpmem_email_headers filter hook.  This will allow you to easily filter the headers for the email process of the plugin giving you the ability to send HTML email without modifying the plugin.
* Added wpmem_user_activated action hook.  This hook will give you the ability to run actions at the end of user activation.  For sites that moderate registration, this gives you the ability to hook in actions that you might not want to do before approval of the registration (such as would normally be done with wpmem_post_register_data).
* Added new shortcode for creating a user list/member directory.  __This shortcode requires installation of the premium add-on module WP-Members User List [available to rocketgeek.com members](https://rocketgeek.com/about/site-membership-subscription/)__. The shortcode has parameters for including a member search function as well as filter hooks for filtering the layout of the directory elements.
* Added new shortcode for protecting inline content with the __premium add-on module WP-Members PayPal Subscription [available to rocketgeek.com members](https://rocketgeek.com/about/site-membership-subscription/)__.

Bug Fix:

* Fixed a bug where the reCAPTCHA error messages do not display on the [shortcode pages "register" and "members-area"](https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/users-guide/shortcodes/page-shortcodes/).

Code Improvement:

* Completed a rebuild of the login function wpmem_login.  Updated the cookie process to switch from [wp_setcookie](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_setcookie) (which is deprecated) to [wp_set_auth_cookie](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_set_auth_cookie). Also, the [wpmem_login_redirect hook](https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/users-guide/filter-hooks/wpmem_login_redirect/) was moved to after the login credentials have been validated and the user is logged in.  This allows the hook to access user data without the need to validate the user within the filter.

= 2.7.6 =

This release has some new features and some code updates

* Added ability to use same redirect_to querystring that WP uses in the wp-login form.  This allows more seamless replacement of the wp-login.
* Added a new page shortcode for password reset/change [wp-members page="password"].  If the user is logged out, it works the reset forgotten password functionality.  If the user is logged in, it will offer the change password functionality.  These functions do also remain in the members-area page shortcode as well, but now can be placed in a stand-alone location as well.
* Added a new page shortcode for the user edit page [wp-members page="user-edit"].  This needs to be used if the user is logged in and can be used with the login status shortcode.
* Removed $content global from the page shortcode function.  This should correct the double form issue when used with plugins/themes that filter $content.
* Added do_shortcode to the page shortcode call.  This should allow the page shortcodes to be used in conjuction with other shortcodes on the page (although this is not necessarily recommended).
* Added translations for Russian, Slovak, and Hindi.
* Moved _OLD forms to wp-members-deprecated.php.  These forms can still be used, but will be deprecated in a future version.  It is highly recommended that users still using legacy forms begin converting to the _NEW forms.

= 2.7.5 =

This is a new feature release (see [release announcement](http://wp.me/p1zYcs-xf) for full details.)

* Added 5 new filter hooks
* Final deprecation of the old style shortcodes for special pages (<!--members-area-->, <!--reg-area-->). If you are using these you need simply need to update to the modern shortcodes such as [wp-members page="members-area"]
* Added a check for the error message variable immediately following the wpmem_pre_register_data and wpmem_pre_update_data action hooks.  This will allow for use of these hooks to include your own custom validation and still be able to return a relevant error message.
* Added a check to see if the TOS field is not being used and thus don't display it on the User Profile for the admin.
* Fixed a bug that showed the incorrect heading on the User Edit page when there is an empty field error.

* Updated all .po/.mo translation files from the new .pot (still need some strings translated for some languages).

* Added wpmem_restricted_msg filter hook to filter the restricted post message.
* Added wpmem_login_failed filter hook to filter the login failed message (includes filtering display markup).
* Added wpmem_login_failed_sb filter hook to filter the login failed message in the sidebar (filters message only, not formatting).

= 2.7.2 =

This is primarily a bug fix release (see [release announcement](http://wp.me/p1zYcs-vW) for full details.)

= 2.6.0 =
This version is a feature release that also includes some rebuilt functions and other code improvements.

New Features:

* Front-end now uses enqueue_style to load CSS, so advanced users can directly load their own styles for the plugin without using the plugin settings.
* Improved use of shortcodes.  Old-style HTML comment shortcodes will continue to work in certain instances, but will no longer be supported in future versions.  Upgrade to the new shortcodes.  Major rewrite of the way WP-Members handles the_content() so that it will return a value rather than echo it.  Working to better integrate with other shortcodes so they are propery parsed.

* updated email validation/error message to registration process to use is_email().

= 2.5.4 =
This is a bug fix release. 2.5.3 introduced a bug where the random password sent to a new user was invalid. While the fix is simple, the nature of the bug related to the functionality of the plugin dictates a full update so that users unaware of the bug will be notified via their WP admin panel.

= 2.5.3 =
This is primarily a bug fix release.

Bug fixes:

* Updated login process to use wp_signon (wp_login is deprecated).
* Updated sidebar widget include a new css class #wp-members .err for login error message
* Updated sidebar widget to use the appropriate `<li>` tag into the sidebar area.  This should only be a factor for users that customized css. In this case, you'll need to update your stylesheet for ID #wpmem_login_side to #wp-members.
* Updated the sidebar login to better direct the user upon successful login (previously working fine on individual posts and pages, but not on categories).
* *Strictly Experimental* - Introducing pluggable functions - laying the ground work, won't be official yet, so some functions may be deprecated and/or modified.

The #1 request with the plugin is to simply be able to change the required fields.  I have greatly simplified the process so it can be managed from within the WP admin panel.  Additionally, I added the ability to determine what fields will show in the registration form (both native WP fields, and additional WP-Members&trade; fields).  Also, the error/dialog messages can now be managed from with the admin panel as well.

* Added new customization features and an admin panel
* Can set fields that will display
* Can set fields to be required
* Can manage error/dialog messages from admin

= 2.1.2 =
* Added fix to set new registrations as the default role

= 2.1.1 =
* Udates for the 2.1.0 release that were not completed.
* updated variables for some function calls.
* eliminated unnecessary $table_prefix globals.
* updated some queries to better utilize the $wpdb class.
* custom fields admin is now managed as an array (cuts the lines of code by 75%, and makes way for user defined custom fields).
